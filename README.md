If you're anything like me, you're a ~~huge nerd~~ engineering major who enjoys
working out problems both on whiteboards and digitally. You might also
have six million photos of your whiteboard work trapped on your phone
or in your Google Drive with no good way to easily group them in with
your other notes.

Inkpath is a project designed to crunch those whiteboard photos into easily
editable [Xournalpp](https://github.com/xournalpp) note files so that you can
drop your whiteboard scrawlings directly into your lecture notes. Convenient!

The project consists of a lua script and a shared object library written in C++
statically linked with some OpenCV utils. The project now uses OpenCV in place
of Autotrace to perform an Otsu Threshold. The thresholded image is then inverted,
and skeletonized, producing the centerline of each individual object in the image
(which at this point should be just markings). The resulting image is then scanned
for contours. These contours are pushed onto the lua stack, and passed to the 
Xournal++ API. Unlike the previous implementation, this operates purely on rasters.

## Installation and Usage

### Prerequisites

You'll need to statically compile and install OpenCV (see `HACKING/build-opencv.sh`), then install Xournalpp using your package manager of choice (or compile from source).

_I'm not 100% sure that all the API changes I've made have been released. They are merged, but might not be in your package manager._

### Installation

1. Download dependencies

**Debian:**
```
apt-get install make liblua5.4-dev build-essential pkg-config libglib2.0-dev libpng-dev
```

**Fedora:**
```
dnf install make lua-devel gcc pkg-config glib2-devel libpng-devel
```

**Arch:**
```
pacman -S base-devel pkg-config lua libpng
```

2. Compile and install Inkpath
```
git clone https://github.com/willnilges/inkpath.git
cd inkpath
make install
```

When you run `make lua-plugin`, it will compile inkpath and place `inkpath.so` in the ImageTranscription directory.`make install` will copy that directory to your Xournalpp plugins folder, and Inkpath will be installed. You can then use it from the 'Plugins' menu from within Xournalpp.

_Inkpath is coming to a package manager near you soonâ„¢!_
