If you're anything like me, you're a ~~huge nerd~~ engineering major who enjoys
working out problems both on whiteboards and digitally. You might also
have six million photos of your whiteboard work trapped on your phone
or in your Google Drive with no good way to easily group them in with
your other notes.

Inkpath is a project designed to crunch those whiteboard photos into easily
editable [Xournalpp](https://github.com/xournalpp) note files so that you can
drop your whiteboard scrawlings directly into your lecture notes. Convenient!

The project consists of a lua script and a shared object library written in C++
statically linked with some OpenCV utils. The project now uses OpenCV in place
of Autotrace to perform an Otsu Threshold. The thresholded image is then inverted,
and skeletonized, producing the centerline of each individual object in the image
(which at this point should be just markings). The resulting image is then scanned
for contours. These contours are pushed onto the lua stack, and passed to the 
Xournal++ API. Unlike the previous implementation, this operates purely on rasters.

## Installation and Usage

Inkpath is packaged as a statically-linked `.so` file coupled with a Lua script,
so you should be able to download the release from the [releases page](https://github.com/WillNilges/inkpath/releases)
and have it Just Work™.

_As of 2022-09-24, the API changes in Xournalpp are merged, but have not made
it into the package managers. You will probably need to [build xournalpp from source](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp/blob/master/readme/LinuxBuild.md)
in order to get them._

_Inkpath is coming to a package manager near you soon™!_
